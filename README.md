# PoE Addon Launcher (PAL)
Is a java based program, used for updating and managing several addons that are commonly used in Path of Exile.

It's to be used to eliminate manual tracking of programs and their updates, and also launches all your addons prior to launching Path of Exile!

Stay up to date with all your favourite addons.

Currently Planned:
- Most common addons ailable for downloading and updating.
- Launching all addons and path of exile with one click.

Work in Progress:
- Overlay to be used in-game that will allow you to use browser based tools such as the Vorici Calc by Siveran.
- Community Repositories
- And much more?

# Closed Source
At the moment the core program is closed source, as I'm tidying up the code and the way I handle connection to my server is something I'd rather keep hidden atm (password visable).
